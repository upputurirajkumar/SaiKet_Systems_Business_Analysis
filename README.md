# Customer Segmentation Visualization & Advanced Analysis

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company using data-driven techniques to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.



Dataset:

The analysis uses a telecommunications customer churn dataset (Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset-3.csv) containing customer information, including:

- Demographics (gender, age, partner/dependents status)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services (phone, internet, streaming, security features)
- Billing details (monthly charges, total charges)
- Churn status (target variable)


Project Objectives

- Understand customer behavior patterns and churn drivers
- Perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights
- Create meaningful customer segmentation visualizations
- Develop predictive insights to identify customers at risk of churning


Key Tasks

- Data Understanding: Load and explore the dataset structure and quality
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and standardize data formats
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualization of key patterns
- Customer Segmentation: Visualize customer distribution by tenure and service usage
- Advanced Analysis: Deep-dive analysis by demographics and service preferences


Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Statistical Analysis
- Business Intelligence techniques


Expected Outcomes

- Clean, analysis-ready dataset
- Comprehensive visualizations and statistical insights
- Customer segmentation profiles
- Recommendations for reducing churn and improving retention


This project is part of the Business Analysis internship program at Saiket Systems.
